Motor used to test is a NEMA-17 size - 200 steps/rev, 12V 350mA.
And the driver is a TB6600 4A 9-42V Nema 17 Stepper Motor Driver.

The driver was connected as follows:
VCC 12 VDC
GND Power supply ground
ENA- Not connected
ENA+ Not connected
DIR- GND
DIR+ GPIO Pin 1
PUL- GND
PUL+ GPIO Pin 0 
A-, A+ Coil 1 stepper motor
