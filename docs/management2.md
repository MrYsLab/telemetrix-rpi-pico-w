# Cleanly Shutting Down

## shutdown
You should always call the shutdown method to exit your application cleanly and
ensure that any streaming data coming from the Pico is halted.

```python
 async def shutdown(self)

    This method attempts an orderly shutdown.
    If any exceptions are thrown, they are ignored.
```
## Example: All the examples call shutdown.

## reset_board

```python
 async def reset_board(self)

    Send a command to the Pico to perform a hardware reset
```

## Example: All the examples call shutdown.
