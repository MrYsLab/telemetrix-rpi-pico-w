Once both the client and server software has been installed, it would be 
an excellent time 
to try an example to verify that bidirectional WI-FI communication is 
working between the server residing on the Pico W and a Python API application.

An excellent candidate is [get_cpu_temperature.py.](https://github.com/MrYsLab/telemetrix-rpi-pico-w/blob/master/examples/get_cpu_temperature.py)
It requires no additional hardware and returns the internal temperature of the Pico W CPU.
